            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in CSE & minoring in Applied Math at the <a
                    href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/">University of California, Merced</a>. I have interests in Robotics,
                Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, Controls, Optimization, & Signal Processing. Once I am finished with my
                time
                as an undergraduate I plan to pursue graduate studies in order to further these interests!

            <dl>
                <dt>Scout Robot Project: UC Merced (on-going)</dt>
                <dd>- The Scout is a semi-autonomous robot whose end goal is to be deployed to forest environments in order to
                    aid workers with laborious tasks such as wood waste removal.
                    This project is being led by Professor Ricardo Pinto de Castro & Professor Hyeran Jeon. My current role is
                    to work with Professor Hyeran and <a href="https://www.mocalab.org/moca-lab">MoCA Lab</a> in
                    order to assist in the development of a power efficient software architecture for the perception of the
                    Scout in order to perform tasks such as data collection, object detection, and
                    person following.
                </dd>
                <dt><a href="https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2023/uc-merced-team-picked-federal-ev-battery-competition">Battery
                        Workforce Challenge: UC Merced</a> (on-going)</dt>
                <dd>- This is a 3 year long competition against 11 other universities being led by Professor Ricardo Pinto de
                    Castro. The goal of this competition is to
                    design, build, test, and integrate an advanced EV battery pack into a vehicle provided by Stellantis.
                    I am currently part of the Battery Pack Software team, and my tasks are to aid in the development of the
                    Battery Management System.
                </dd>
                <dt><a href="SRI_UCM.html">Summer Research Internship: UC Merced</a></dt>
                <dd>- I worked on a summer research project for 9 weeks under the supervision of Professor Ricardo Pinto de
                    Castro. The project consisted of applying the concepts of power electronics and control theory
                    to validate the correctness of a new control algorithm for dual half bridge power converters. During
                    this
                    project I utilized technologies such as Matlab Simulink and a Hardware in the Loop testbench
                    for real time testing.
                </dd>
                <dt><a href="https://boschfuturemobility.com/">Bosch Future Mobility Challenge: UC Merced</a></dt>
                <dd>- Along side three other undergraduate students, I worked on programming a small scale autonomous
                    vehicle
                    with the purpose of navigating a city-like environment. During this project I was introduced
                    to technologies such as ROS, YOLO, and various Microcontrollers.
